# Space-Invader

I learned a bit of SFML like how to make a window and draw some stuff.
I practiced this stuff by making a space invaders type game. 
The game isn't done and I'm not sure if I will continue this because 
it was more of an exercise to use SFML and learn some OOP concepts.

The game is just squares and such.
