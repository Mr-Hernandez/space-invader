# Space-Invader

I learned a bit of SFML like how to make a window and draw some stuff.
I practiced this stuff by making a space invaders type game. 
The game isn't done and I'm not sure if I will continue this because 
it was more of an exercise to use SFML and learn some OOP concepts.

The game is just squares and such.

# Update: Added Cmake file to build
Currently only set up for Linux env

To build do the following.
1. Download it to its own folder
2. Run the command ```bash buildGame.sh```
3. Run the command ```./space-invader-exe```

# Dependencies
SFML 2.5  
Linux Env (maybe I ran it on windows using WSL2)  
cmake 3.1 or greater (just use this to build)
